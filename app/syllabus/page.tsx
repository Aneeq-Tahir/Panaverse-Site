        This curriculum is intended for beginners who want to learn software
        development from the ground up. The first two quarters are shared by all
        specialities and are dedicated to studying Object-Oriented Programming
        and cutting-edge Full-Stack Web 2.0 development. It is going to be a
        year-long hybrid programme that includes both onsite and online classes
        and is divided into four quarters of 13 weeks each. The emphasis will be
        on hands-on learning by educating students to produce projects. To
        accommodate everyone, courses will be held primarily on weekends or
        after 6:00 p.m. (Pakistan Time) on weekdays. It employs a hybrid
        teaching format, with core onsite classes complemented by online Zoom
        laboratories and recorded videos.

          In this quarter you will learn how to develop Web 3.0 DApps, create a
          project, deploy it in production, write smart contracts, unit test
          them, and create user interfaces for them. We will also learn to
          develop ERC-20 and NFT tokens, DAOs, Oracles, etc. Please note that in
          order to develop Web 3 applications you also need to build on top of
          Web 2.0 technologies which we have already covered in the previous
          quarters.

          The Web is the Metaverse. The metaverse requires an infrastructure
          that connects all of the metaverses so that we can travel between them.
          This is only achievable with open web-based metaverses. The internet
          and its browsers are magical. Federated but linked experiences connect
          pages, people, technology, businesses, standards, and nations. Itâ€™s unlike
          anything else. The metaverse should replicate the best qualities of
          the web - it should just be the web. We just have to extend online
          responsive design from mobile to desktop to 3D, Augmented Reality, and
          Virtual Reality. This course will teach you how to build the Open Social
          Spatial Web with WebXR and WebGPU technologies.
